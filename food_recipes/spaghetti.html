After listening to Stanley Tucci lose his mind about this pasta and calling 
it life-changing and one of the best things he's ever eaten, I decided I'd give it a try. 
The results were amazing and the key to getting the toasted sweet taste of the zucchini was deep-frying it!

<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed  </li>
  <li>6 medium green zucchini  </li>
  <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li> 
</ul>   

<h2> How to cook step-by-step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.  </li>
        <li> Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on <br>
            paper towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.  </li>
        <li>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, <br>
            until it's 2 minutes away from being tender yet firm to the bite, 9 to 10 minutes.</li> 
      </ol>
